# Eutectic alloys fusible links for medium loads  

ROHS compliance: Non- ROHS & ROHS.  
This brass fusible link has a medium response time, between 3 minutes and 3 minutes 10 seconds,  
for a temperature rise rate of 20°C/min from 25°C and their thickness of metal gives them
sufficient strength for their use in multiplied mechanisms supporting a maximum load of 300DaN. 
The holes have a lip to improve their resistance to mechanical break at 25°C by avoiding the tearing of the metal.
