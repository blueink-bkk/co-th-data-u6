# Thermal actuators with pulling action, for fire dampers, operated by thermal bulb

Material: 304 Stainless steel.  
Tripping force: 15 DaN.  
Thermal bulb dimensions: Dia 5*20mm.  
These mechanical thermal actuators are intended to close the fire dampers used on 
the ventilation ducts. Their large operating force unlocks the spring actuating the damper.
Requiring no power supply, these devices are particularly simple and reliable.
