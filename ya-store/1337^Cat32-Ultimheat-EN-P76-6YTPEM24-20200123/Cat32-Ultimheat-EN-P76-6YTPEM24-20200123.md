# M24 cable gland, short thread, in black PA6
This cable gland has been developed for applications in which the standard M25 
model is too bulky. The reduced length of the thread (8.5mm) makes it possible 
to mount it on enclosures with thin walls, without too much encroaching on the 
interior space. It has an O-ring to ensure the tightness with the enclosure, 
and the nut is self-locking. It allows passing cable diameters up to 14mm 
and also oblong cables used in heat tracing. Made in PA6 UL94V2. Gaskets 
are available in 65 shore silicone or NBR 70 shore.  
Options: Flat external gasket and counter nut in PA6.
