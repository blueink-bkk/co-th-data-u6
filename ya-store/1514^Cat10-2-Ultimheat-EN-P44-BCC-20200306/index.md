Flexible mineral-insulated cables are designed to provide optimum fire 
resistance. They generally use mica-based insulation and special silicones, 
and they are designed to give the ultimate fire performance. Used in power 
and control circuits, they are providing circuit integrity during a 15 to 180 
minutes fire depending of models. They usually have a continuous operating 
temperature up to 200Â°C. They are used in places where it is important 
to have an interrupted power supply in case of fire.
