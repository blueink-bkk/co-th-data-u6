# Thermal actuators with pulling action, for fire dampers, operated by eutectic fusible link

Material: 304 Stainless steel.  
Tripping force: 15 DaN.  
Fusible link hole distance: 22-25mm.  
These mechanical thermal actuators are intended to close the fire dampers used on 
the ventilation ducts. Their large operating force unlocks the spring actuating 
the damper. Requiring no power supply, these devices are particularly simple and reliable.
