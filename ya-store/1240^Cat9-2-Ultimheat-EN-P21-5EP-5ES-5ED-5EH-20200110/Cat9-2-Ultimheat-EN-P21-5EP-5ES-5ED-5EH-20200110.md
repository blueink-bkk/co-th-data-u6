# Copper fusible links with eutectic alloys, for medium loads

ROHS compliance: Non- ROHS & ROHS.
These fusible links have a medium response time, between 3 minutes 25 seconds and 3 minutes 30 seconds, for a temperature rise rate of 20°C/min from 25°C, and their thickness of metal is thicker than brass models to gives them sufficient strength for their use in multiplied mechanisms supporting a maximum stress of 300DaN.
