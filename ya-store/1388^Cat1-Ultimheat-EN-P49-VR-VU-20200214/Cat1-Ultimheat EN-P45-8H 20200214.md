# SPDT Bimetal rod thermostats with dead zone

Applications: These thermostats have a rod section that is not sensible 
to temperature. This allows to keep the thermostat head away from high 
temperatures. Therefore, they are more used in air duct temperature control.  
Temperature ranges: 0-100°C, 0-200 °C, 0-300°C, 0-400°C.  
Material: PA66 housing, and Aisi 304 stainless steel rod.  
Temperature sensing element: Invar/stainless steel bimetal rod, temperature sensing.  
Rating: 16(4)A 250/400VAC. Reduced differential model is not recommended for 400V applications.  
Contacts: SPDT, snap action.  
Max ambient temperature on the head: 85°C (185°F).
