# Technical over-molding of thermostats

Connecting thermostats to wires or cables is the most critical point in regard to 
the mechanical strength and resistance to water penetration.  
Over-molding improves the mechanical strength of the assembly and provides a 
good ingress protection to water.  
Over-molded thermostat on heat tracing cable. The assembly is waterproof, frost proof, short immersion proof, protects the connection of the power cord to the heating cable.
Defrost termination over-molded thermostat. 
Over-molded junction between cord and heat tracing cable.
