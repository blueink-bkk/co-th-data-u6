# Ceramic cable outlets

Ceramic cable outlet for ovens and kilns and furnaces, allows 
to pass electrical conductors through a metal wall in areas where 
the temperature is too high for plastics. The temperature resistance 
is given by the material of the nut: 230°C with nickel-plated brass nut, 
500°C with stainless steel nut.
