# Round steatite connection blocks 450V range

Not protected against accidental electric contact, brass terminals, nickel plated steel screws.
These terminal blocks are intended to be placed in tubes, or to go 
into round holes during their installation. If a minimum clearance of 4mm in air is 
not achievable, we recommend the installation of an insulating sheath around the 
terminal block, for example high temperature heat-shrinkable sleeve, 
or Kapton tape, whose temperature resistance is compatible with the conditions 
of the installation. This insulation must provide an electric strength of 2500V minimum.
