# Thermal actuators with pulling action, for fire dampers, operated by eutectic fusible link

Material: 304 Stainless steel.  
Tripping force: 15 DaN.  
Fusible link hole distance: 22-25mm.  
These mechanical thermal actuators are intended to close the fire dampers used on the 
ventilation ducts. Their large operating force unlocks the spring actuating the damper. 
Requiring no power supply, these devices are particularly simple and reliable.
