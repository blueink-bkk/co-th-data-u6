# Very high temperature steatite connection blocks, 750V range. Terminals and screws in stainless steel

Not protected against accidental electric contact, indirect pressure clamping 
by saddle, flat backside.  
Applications: These terminal blocks have been developed to meet the specific 
needs of connections that must withstand very high temperatures, up to 500°C (930°F) 
permanently and 750°C (1290°F) peak. They also ensure the continuity of the 
connection in case of fire up to 900°C (1650°F). Because of their construction, 
they are non-flammable and resistant to moisture.
