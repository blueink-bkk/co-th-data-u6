# Slow action contact miniature air switches for printed circuit boards with 6.35mm pitch

Uses: Low voltage, high sensivity.
Main applications: Electronic printed circuits and remote controls for spa, 
swimming pools and saunas. This pressure switch is more sensible than snap 
action models and allows longer tubing distance.  
Fluid: air.  
Contact: single pole normally open, slow make.  
Electrical rating:
- Silver contact: max 1A 250V.
- Gold plated contact: max 100 mA, 24V.
Action: momentary, close on pressure impulse.  
Electrical connection: printed circuit terminal, dia 1mm, 12.7mm spacing.
