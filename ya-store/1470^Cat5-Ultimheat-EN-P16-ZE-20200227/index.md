# Slow action contact miniature pressure switches for printed circuit boards with 5mm pitch, plastic fitting

Uses: Low voltage, high sensivity.  
Main applications: Electronic printed circuit. This pressure switch is more 
sensible than snap action models and can be calibrated at lower pressure values. 
Very small differential.  
Fluid: water or air.  
Pressure: positive.  
Housing: PA66, UL94 VO.  
Contact: single pole normally closed, slow break.  
Electrical rating:
- Silver contact: max 1A 250V.
- Gold plated contact: max 100 mA, 24V.
Action: momentary, open on pressure rise.
Maximum pressure: 2 bars (29 PSI).
