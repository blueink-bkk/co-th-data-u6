# Thermal actuators with pushing action, for fire dampers, operated by thermal glass bulb

Material: 304 Stainless steel.  
Tripping force: 15 DaN.  
Thermal bulb dimensions: DIA 5 * 20mm.  
These mechanical thermal actuators are intended to close the fire dampers used on 
the ventilation ducts. Their large operating force unlocks the spring actuating 
the damper. Requiring no power supply, these devices are particularly simple 
and reliable. They are mandatory for all fire dampers to meet the NF-S 61.937 standard.
