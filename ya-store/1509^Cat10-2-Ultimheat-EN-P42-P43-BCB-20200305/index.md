# Very high temperature steatite connection blocks, 750V range. Terminals and screws in stainless steel

Not protected against accidental electric contact, indirect pressure clamping 
by saddle, elevated thermal insulating backside.  
Applications: These terminal blocks have been developed to meet the specific 
needs of connections that must withstand very high temperatures, 
up to 500°C (930°F) permanently and 750°C (1290°F) peak. They also ensure 
the continuity of the connection in case of fire up to 900°C (1650°F) 
(Their subsequent replacement is then necessary). Because of their construction, 
they are non-flammable and resistant to moisture.
