# M20 cable gland, short thread, in black PA6, IP68

The reduced length of the thread makes it possible to mount it on enclosures 
with thin walls, without too much encroaching on the interior space. 
It has an O-ring to ensure the tightness with the enclosure, and the 
compression nut is self-locking. It allows to pass cable diameters up 
to 12mm. Made in PA6 UL94V2. Gaskets are available in 65 shore silicone or NBR 70 shore.  
Options: flat or O-ring gasket and counter nut in PA6, inside gasket in NKM (Viton).
