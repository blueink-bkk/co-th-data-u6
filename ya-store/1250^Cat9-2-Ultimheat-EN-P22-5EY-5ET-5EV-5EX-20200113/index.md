# Eutectic alloys fusible links, for direct handling of heavy loads

ROHS compliance: Non- ROHS & ROHS.  
This fusible links has a response time near the highest limit requested by standard (whose threshold is 4 minutes),  
between 3 minutes 30 seconds and 3 minutes 50 seconds, for a temperature rise rate of 20°C/min from 25°C. Their 1.5mm metal thickness
and their soldering surface make it possible to withstand directly and without multiplying mechanism the loads encountered in 
the opening or closing mechanisms of fire doors and shutters.
